# Mux
Vivado turns all circuits into the primitives of a CLB Slice: LUTs, muxes, carry-logic, xor gates, d flip flops. Understanding these is the goal of this course. We have covered XOR gates and LUTs. The goal now is to cover muxes.

#### Testing

This mux is implemented both with gates, tristate and RTL. 

*What are the differences between the three at after RTL Analysis?* 

*What are the differences between the three when implemented in the FPGA?*

*What are the differences after synthesis in the schematic?*

*What happened in the Device implementation to these three? are they all the same or different?*

*Is the RTL implementation in your opinion too cryptic?* 

*Harmonize the ? : with the description of these assign conditional symbols in this  [ut](https://www.utdallas.edu/~akshay.sridharan/index_files/Page5212.htm) manual.* 

*Can you leverage any of these to make a m4x2 mux? Describe what you tried here before looking at the m4x2 mux project.*

*Where is the original documentation for this command that creates muxes?* 
Exhaust 10 minutes trying to find it. List off the keywords you used to search for an explanation and URL's that you find that are closer than these:

This presentation from [Standford](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/ee/ee371/ee371.1066/tools/verilog_tips.pdf) talks about how to build arrays of wires but not this command.  This is a lab from [University of Maryland College Park](https://ece.umd.edu/class/enee245.S2015/Lab7.pdf) very similar to this lab, but doesn't mention this technique.  This is a [link](http://electrosofts.com/verilog/mux.html) that inspired the instructor to start playing around with this command.  [Cliff Cummings](http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/)  is an engineer that has been at the forefront of driving Verilog and System Verilog evolution.

## Ethics

The ethics questions below are more important than your answers. The goal in answering them is to remember the question. So the best answers are a non-trivial, thoughtful, relevant hypothesis. 

#### Ethics of Change

The simplicity of the RTL versions of the mux command raises the question of what is possible with the assign command? Where is the manual that goes over all this? Where can we discover what is possible? The problem is that there are many manuals with complete backwards compatibility to the dawn of verilog history in the 1980's.  These are the official Verilog standards.  They are all supersets .. meaning some vendors (Vivado) **don't** implement everything. 

​	IEEE 1364-1995 (Verilog 1995)  
​	IEEE  1364-2001 (Verilog 2001)   
​	IEEE  1364-2005 (Verilog 2005)  
​	IEEE  1800-2005 (SystemVerilog)  
​	IEEE  1800-2009 (SystemVerilog)  
​	IEEE  1800-2012 (SystemVerilog)   
​	IEEE  1364-2014 ([Verilog-AMS 2.4](http://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/v-ams))    

It is impossible to test thousands inputs combinations and state transitions by hand. This problem coupled with the chaos of Verilog subsets of a superset make searching the internet for verilog solutions problematic. The reasons for this chaos involve testing.  This is discussed below. But first we must look at the ethics of change. 

Engineers are professionals like doctors and lawyers. They are by law allowed, protected and encouraged to experiment/improve at every opportunity. Engineers make new versions. Doctors improve treatment and surgery techniques.  Lawyers find new ways to interpret laws and dream up new ones. This constant change creates a chaos. 

Technicians, nurses and paralegals & judges are the anchors, the experts, the people that build walls around this change. They extract from the chaos what works, complain about what doesn't and become the conservative force that captures what is good for society. **In the process technicians, nurses and paralegals become experts.**  Engineers, doctors and lawyers are merely artists. There is lots of research showing that once the human species captures some knowledge, it never forgets .. even if the number of individuals knowing a very small piece of it becomes much smaller than during the technology's growth period. 

This part of society works. But there is a down side. A barrier, a Catch22 starts growing for those trying to become Engineers or Technicians, Doctors or Nurses. Specialization, complexity, pre-requisite knowledge starts growing. A new generation has trouble getting a job. They ask "How can I get the experience the job says I need without getting the job?" An old generation creates a bubble around themselves. The younger generation sees this as a barrier to entry. The older generation retires. Society in general get's scared.  Standing still, repeating success is a disaster for any organization. 

*So how does a younger generation pop a generation bubble or climb over the experience barrier and get a job?*

*What does the younger generation have to do on their resume and while in college ... when the complexity, the accumulated knowledge, the expertise, the experience required seems impossible to accumulate?*

*How does a young generation serve the world, the human species popping this generational bubble?*
