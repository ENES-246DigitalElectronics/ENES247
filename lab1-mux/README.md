# Mux
[Inspiration for this lab](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/university/Vivado-Teaching/HDL-Design/2015x/Verilog/docs-pdf/lab1.pdf)

Vivado turns all circuits into the primitives of a CLB Slice: LUTs, muxes, carry-logic, xor gates, d flip flops. Understanding these is the goal of this course. We have covered XOR gates and LUTs. The goal now is to cover muxes.

#### Testing

Two muxes are implemented using the same inputs with the same select line.  So if the two are equal, their outputs should be equal.  SW[0]- a , SW[1]-b,  SW[2]-select, outputs are the first two LEDs. 

#### Questions/Tasks

*In the RTL schematic, what is RTL_Mux g1_i doing?*

*Which of the two verilog implemented muxes actually created a tristate symbol in the RTL schematic?*

*After Synthesis, which of the two verilog implemented muxes looks more simple?*

*After Synthesis, why hasn't Vivado detected that the two circuits are identical?*

*After implementation, does the schematic change? If so, put a screen shot here.*

*Do the insides of the device reflect the schematic .. after implementation?*

*What are the truth tables of the one or two LUT(s)? Put a screen shot(s) here.*

*Are the truth tables the same or different? Why would Vivado do this? Is this a bug in Vivado?*

*Do some tests modifying this project. Can you make the one line of code mux into a 4 input, 2 select line, 1 output mux in one line?*

#### Questions/Tasks

*This circuit is similar to which previous circuit?*

The @* is the clearest indication of verilog evolution and the difference between system verilog and regular verilog. Here is a summary. Later we will read the [Cliff Cummings, SunBurst paper](http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2016SV_SVLogicProcs.pdf) paper on this topic. 

​	always @(y,x) .. too many mistakes, hard to read code ..
​	always @(\*) .. any variable on the right hand side of an equal sign
​	always @\* ..  since 2001 .. just forget the parenthesizes

*Why is there so much verilog code using old forms of the always command on the internet?*

The always @* can not reference a clock. There is no clock in our circuit. It is combinational logic.  One can tell it is combinational logic by looking at the = sign in the begin/end code.  This means that it is executed in sequence .. at near the speed of light. 

*reg stands for what?*

*What is m driven by in the previous similar circuit?*

*What is a reg m driven by in this circuit .. when just looking at the verilog code?*

*How is the RTL Schematic of this circuit different the pervious similar circuit?*

A reg typically uses a D-flip flop inside an FPGA slice. *Do you see any evidence in the schematic or in the device itself of the reg?*

Reg without a clock is called a latch. Vivado hates latches. It goes to extremes to eliminate latches.
Read through the Messages this circuit generates.  *Does any message say it is not creating a reg?*

This verilog code is described by Vivado tutorials as at the behavioral abstraction level (..a good thing.. above RTL abstraction level). *What is good about it since the reg was essentially ignored?*

*Given that RTL programming involves reg, is it a requirement that RTL verilog coding cause the use of an FPGA CLB's D-flip flop?*

*Which verilog code is more "C" like, this code or the previous similar circuit?* *Why?*

This mux can be [implemented with one line of code](https://github.com/ENES-246DigitalElectronics/ENES246/blob/master/-5MuxOfMux/m2x1Mux/m2x1Mux.srcs/sources_1/new/m2x1mux.v):  assign m = s ? x : y; 
*Why isn't this talked about above? Why isn't this given the name RTL verilog or Behavioral verilog?*

## lab1_3_mux2-1-2bitwide-reg

The simple mux circuits explored in this lab were created with various forms of the if then else command above. The single line of code is **if else** short hand. But it can not grow larger muxes. But what does a larger mux mean? There are two answers to that question explored below.

#### Questions/Tasks

*How is this code different from the previous project?*

Circuits get large several ways. One way is doing many things in parallel.  Parallel is like herding cattle .. the goal being a couple of horses and dogs guiding cattle. Here in select line is guiding the path of 2 cows. *Re-write this code to guide 64 cows.* 

Another [single line of code that synthesizes](https://github.com/ENES-246DigitalElectronics/ENES246/tree/master/-5MuxOfMux/m16x4MuxRTL) a mux is:  assign m = i[s]; 
where i[0]=x and i[1]=y. This scales from having 2 inputs on two wires and 1 select line one wire, to 32 inputs with 5 select lines ... a bigger mux rather than multiple copies of the same mux. *How many select lines would be needed to choose one of 128 cows?* 

*Begin [reading this document](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/ee/ee371/ee371.1066/tools/verilog_tips.pdf) and then answer this question .. Is it worth trying to create a design tool that can create multiple copies and grow larger at the same time?* 

Answer the previous question from the big picture point of view, not from the (is it possible) point of view.  A mux is an old digital design concept. RTL is a new concept. Behavior modeling with verilog **if else** and **reg** is very similar to C. When learning to programming, was learning a mux a pre-requisite? **No.**  *Is it worth learning about a mux?* 

*What is the largest mux that would fit in a 6 input LUT?*

In the Implementation Device screen, there are pictures of a mux. *Why does vivado implement **if else** in a LUT when it has muxes in the configuration logic blocks (CLB)?* 

[Fast Carry Logic](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug474_7Series_CLB.pdf) speeds up any math the FPGA does. More on this in Lab 2. But this is one reason why muxes exist in the CLB. On page 42 there is this diagram: ![1548790399124](1548790399124.png)

*When does vivado implement the CLB muxes?*

*Is fast carry logic a control path or data path concept?* 

## lab1_4_2-mux2-1inSequence

One of the ways we know what is going on is to predict Vivado's behavior. This circuit uses two select lines, but only selects between 3 inputs. Normally two select lines chooses between four inputs. So this is not quite a mux.

#### Testing

#### Questions/Tasks

*Which of the two modules above is the top level module?*

*What is the symbol for top level module in the vivado design sources hierarchy?*

*Which of the two modules above has nets (wires) mentioned in the XDC file?*

What are the lower level module instantiation names? 

*What in the XDC file is the wire ul_o connected to?*

Do an experiment.  Change the .x, .y, .z and .m order in the instantiation. *Does the code still produce the same RTL schematic?*

Do another experiment. Remove .x, .y, .s and .m along with the parentheses () in the module instantiation, **but keep the original order that matches the instantiated module**.  *Does this code still produce the same RTL schematic?*

Think about a big project. You start off writing the smaller modules and testing. Then you write larger and larger modules. The larger modules call the smaller modules. Two very different larger modules may re-use the same smaller module.  Port Interface drawings keep track of the net names, but not the order defined in the lower module. Mapping higher module net names to lower module net names means having to know what order they were originally in .. in the lower module.  *Which of the above net mapping techniques between modules makes it only necessary to map wire names, not order?*

*Does the RTL schematic show the two instantiated modules?* 

*What does the Plus sign mean?*

How does the synthesized schematic change? 

*How many LUTs does the synthesized schematic indicate will be used?*

*After implementation, does the schematic change?*

The LUT has 5 inputs and a truth table of all their possible combinations.  *Where is this truth table in the Vivado interface (hint: netlist)?*

*Take a screenshot of the truth table and put it here.*

*Find where I4, I3, .. I0 are mapped to the top level input nets. Put the screen shot here.*

*Is there any order to the mapping?*



 

## Ethics

These ethics questions are related to the community of engineers working for industry, working for Xilinx, and working to teach about this subject.  Together they have to create standards.  Verilog is called a standard by the IEEE.

*Describe the success of the verilog standard.*

*Do you think the IEEE, the largest, international, engineering standards organization, lays down law that Engineers world wide have to follow?* 

*Are engineers involved with precise, universally known best practice that hasn't changed for over 100 years or are technicians?* 

*Why are there all these different ways of implementing a mux in verilog when vivado turns them all into the same thing .. a LUT?* 

*If there is one good, true way of implementing a mux in verilog, why not just teach/learn that?*

*Given the chaos of the verilog standard, does this excite you as an engineer with visions of an opportunity?  Does it give you visions of a job reducing the chaos, unexplored cracks where there are possible significant improvements in productivity, possible unknown territory that the standard hasn't addressed? Or does it depress you?*

*What does chaos feel like?*

*Describe the tremendous advantages a fresh young mind has when confronted with chaos.* 

*Having learned about a chaos, visualize the advantages one has when confronted with one of these opportunities:  .. getting a doctorate, working for Xilinx or using Xilinx tools in a competitive engineering company.* 

*Given that Fortran hasn't changed since the 1960's, C hasn't changed since the 1970's. Java and C++ haven't changed for [decades](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), do these languages excite you as an engineer or depress you?*

Almost all software today has verilog code generators including matlab, python, Lab View. A lot of this code will pass Simulation on [EDAplayground](https://www.edaplayground.com/) or will only work with specific hardware.  *What are the chances that generated code will work in Vivado?* 

*How universal is the digital design process, how universal are the design documents and the symbols they contain that are entered into and looked at in matlab, python and LabView?*

*What is the market share of [Xilinx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/17/xilinxs-project-everest-looks-like-bad-news-for-in.aspx)?*
