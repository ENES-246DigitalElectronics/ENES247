## 1_32bitHexTo16LEDs

This code tests the ability to count clock pulses and display 32 bits split into two groups of 16. SW[0] switches between the two groups.

## 2_32bitBCDto16LEDs

Modify the above code using this [algorithm](https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~nmcdonal/Tutorials/BCDTutorial/BCDConversion.html) to work with 32 bits rather than 16. Which of these three is the starting point?

In addition, modify the number of bits counted, and add an overflow if needed or a reset to the counter so it doesn't appear to count to a large number and then hang or do something strange.
